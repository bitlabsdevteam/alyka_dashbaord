## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Node.js:** (LTS version recommended) Includes npm.
*   **npm, yarn, or pnpm:** A package manager for installing dependencies.
*   **Docker and Docker Compose:** (Optional, but recommended) For containerized development and deployment.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**

Open your terminal and clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitlabsdevteam/alyka_dashbaord.git
cd alyka_dashbaord
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies using your preferred package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm):

```bash
npm install
# or yarn install
# or pnpm install
```

**3. Environment Variables (if applicable):**

*Check if there is a `.env.example` file in the root directory. If so, copy it to `.env` and update the variables as needed.*

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit the .env file with your specific configurations
```
*(Note: As of the current state, no `.env.example` was found. This step is included as a common practice and should be followed if such a file is added later.)*

**4. Run the Application:**

You have two primary options to run the application:

*   **Using Docker Compose (Recommended for consistency):**

    This will build the Docker images and start the services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. Ensure Docker Desktop is running.

    ```bash
docker-compose up --build
    ```

    The application should become available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `docker-compose.yml`).

*   **Running Locally (without Docker):**

    You can run the Next.js development server directly.

    ```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
    ```

    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or yarn build
# or pnpm build
```

## Running in Production

After building, you can start the production server:

```bash
npm start
# or yarn start
# or pnpm start
```
